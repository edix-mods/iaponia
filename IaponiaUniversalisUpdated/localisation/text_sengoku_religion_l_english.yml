Founded by Ignatius Loyla only a few decades before the offical start of the Counter-Reformatio, and then made famous by St. Francis Xavier, the first missionary to Japan, they embodied both the moral strigency and intellectualism of the Counter-Reformation."

Rejecting both the extravagance of the Jesuits and the theological accomodation they showed in China, they focused more on monasticism and their clerical vows of poverty, in addition to advocating for closer ties with Spain."

Our pagan subjects have begun to accept the ideals of Confucianism and our local officials have also integrated elements of the local religion and culture in our wider Confucian corpus of ideals. As local bureaucrats enter our administration the pagan customs have to some extent began to filter upwards. Even among prominent officials in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] a small altar can sometimes be found to a TODO!Bear? Crab???

Where there was once distrust in the classics and our system for education and governance there is now widespread understanding. In turn our Christian subjects have been taken in and made part of our [Root.GovernmentName], and some of their customs have now become ours. In [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] even some of the best educated Confucian scholars can be seen partaking in Christian customs and visiting Christian churches."

Muslim ideals have been integrated and harmonized with our traditions, rites and methods and we have taken the best of what the religion has had to offer to mold to our own uses. Islamic scholars, doctors, merchants, farmers and peasants can be found even in the districts around [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].

For a long time it was believed that where we lauded reason and classical learning they strived for diversity and an ancient spiritual power. Over the last years, however, we have strived to integrate the Dharmic society with ours and make their beliefs fit in with our equally strong traditions of philosophy and learning. As we look ahead a common future beckons where the diversity of the Dharmic pantheon can be cherished together with the Confucian classics. Together we have created a new stronger set of rites and traditions for a stronger and more durable state."

In a newfound fascination for their ancient Abrahamic religion we have done what we can to integrate them in our rites, traditions and education. As we have strived to harmonize the Confucian classics with the teachings of the Torah Jewish philosophers, traders, soldiers and artisans have become evermore present parts of our society.

It was clear that we had much to learn from these teachings, as they could learn much from our superior tradition of reason, justice and fairness. When communities such as the one in [zoroastrian_province.GetName] became part of our [Root.GovernmentName] it allowed our traditions to begin a new phase of harmonization, fusing the ancient teachings of Zoroaster with those of Confucius. We are still a country where the classics are learned and lived by but Zoroastrians are now an integral part of our society and to some extent their wisdom has become ours."
 ryukyu_faith.6.a: "'Submit the people of virtue, assimilate the people with enlightenment.'"

 ryukyu_faith.7.d: "The Japanese have over time come to incorporate both the traditions of Confucius and Buddha into their own old Shinto faith, taking what they feel was the truest and best serving parts of the foreign teachings and making it their own. In many ways this has in turn made their religion easier to incorporate and harmonize with the ideology of [Root.GetName]. As time goes by the Shinto identity becomes less and less of an issue and Shinto followers can be found high and low in [Root.GetAdjective] society, forming a new group within our complex government apparatus that an outsider would have a very hard time distinguishing from our own."

Over time these collections of laws and rites have come to be studied and made part of the corpus that every educated and influential member of our society must study and adhere to. The traditions have been harmonized and the wider Theravada Buddhist community consider us their equal just as we consider the Theravada Buddhists within our borders as an integral part of our [Root.GovernmentName]."

 ryukyu_faith.9.d: "Centuries ago the teachings of Buddha started to penetrate our lands and by now it is one of the most widespread religions in [Root.GetName]. While we hold the classics of Confucian learning to be the guiding principle of our [Root.GovernmentName] we also honor the traditions of Buddha and the yearning for an end to the eternal cycle that many of our subjects feel.\nTruly we are a Confucian country ruled by a people of Mahayana Buddhists."

Where they once used the traditions of the Vajrayana way to judge the world they are now incorporating the same classics that we have. Vajrayana monks and nobles are now part of our government both at the very top and at the very bottom and their somewhat wild and Tantric traditions appears to have been tamed by our reason and learning."

 ryukyu_faith.11.t: "Concept of Shangdi"
 ryukyu_faith.11.d: "The followers of the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faith have increasingly come to integrate Confucian concepts and our rites in their daily life. A recent trend is to identify the concept of Shangdi with their own supreme deities. This interpretation is somewhat unorthodox to the scholar experts of our [Root.GovernmentName], but it has allowed the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faithful to integrate a number of Confucian concepts, rites, constants and classical teaching in their theology.\nThere is some debate in the palace halls of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] if this is the right and proper way on the path for the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] adherents to elevate themselves from barbarians to Hua."

 ryukyu_faith.12.d:1 "Believers of the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faith are a people with strong traditions and rites and their adherence to the archaic language of their own teachings is holding them back from progressing towards civilization. If they are to ever elevate themselves from the Barbarian Yi of this world we must perhaps ensure that the classics and the proper rites are available for them to digest in their own language.\nThere are some scholars that have already begun to create such works. Should we encourage them to continue synthesizing their old religious concepts with the sublime principles of Confucius?"

Surprised at [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] findings, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has started to adopt many [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] concepts after studying their science and literature intensely. Many worry that [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has gotten too taken in by [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] ways.

A civilized people is supposed to abide by what is right and logical according the Confucian teachings, but these men and women have many customs in direct contradiction of such rules. Our officials in [harmonization_province.GetName] have been struggling with the locals who insist on their barbarous ways."

 ryukyu_faith.14.b: "Such minor things do not concern us."

 ryukyu_faith.15.d: "While the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] are barbarians, they have some customs and rites that we might make use of. As their traditions and ceremonies regarding rulership already contains a concept of a high worldly power such as our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] this is something we could make good use of. Local officials in [harmonization_province.GetName] have already been doing so but it has been suggested that we make use of [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] ceremonies even at higher levels. Others argue that we would be shaming our ancestors and turning our back on what is proper if we allowed these traditions to contaminate ours."

When our [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetTitle] [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetName] visited the area of [harmonization_province.GetName], [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetSheHe] found that they are still far from civilized, however. When a local influential landholder, Lord [Root.local_influential_person.GetName], invited [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetHerHim] to participate in a naming ceremony for his son in which he named the boy after himself, that was the final straw.\n\n[Root.Dip_Advisor.GetName] returned from the area with a very low opinion of the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] people and of their prospects to ever count themselves among the civilized people of the world."
