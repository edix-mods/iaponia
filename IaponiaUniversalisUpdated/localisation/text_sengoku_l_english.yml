 ONIN_JAP: "The Onin War"
 ONIN_DESC: "Ever since the assissination of Yoshinori Ashikaga by Mitsusuke Akamatsu in 1441, followed by the murder of Noritada Uesugi and the establishment of two opposing Kanto Kubo in 1454, the authority and reach of the Ashikaga Shogunate has been in rapid decline. This was further exacerbated by the rivalry between Sozen Yamana and Katsumoto Hosokawa, the two most powerful of Yoshimasa Ashikaga's vassals, and a civil war within the Hatakeyama - open war between the opposing factions was inevitable."
 MEIO_JAP: "The Meio Coup"
 MEIO_DESC: "The Onin War ended in 1477 with no winner and all sides exhausted - the real loser, however, was obvious. The Ashikaga Shogunate had proven to be completely incapable of preventing and resolving the conflict, and the aftershocks of it were felt all across Japan. The Hosokawa proceeded to remove Yoshitane Ashikaga and replace him with the puppet Yoshizumi, with Yoshitane fleeing first to the Hatakeyama in Etchu and then Ouchi in Suo in search of a champion. Coups were not isolated to Koyto, with Soun Hojo having launched his invasion of Kanto in 1491, and a number of Ikki revolts springing up elsewhere across Japan."
 FUNAOKAYAMA_JAP: "The Battle of Funaokayama"
 FUNAOKAYAMA_DESC: "The Ouchi army had been the last to leave Kyoto during the Onin War. With the famed Yoshioki Ouchi at its helm, they returned to the capital as Yoshitane Ashikaga's guardians in 1508. As Matsumoto Hosokawa - Katsumoto's successor - had been murdered the year prior and a war of succession had broken out amongst the Hosokawa, they were in little position to stop the Ouchi's arrival. While Takakuni Hosokawa kow-towed to the restored Shogun, his rival, Sumimoto, plotted to retake the capital for Yoshizumi, only to be soundly defeated at Funaokayama. Yoshizumi Ashikaga fell in the battle, forcing Sumimoto to flee to Awa and leaving the Ouchi's rule uncontested."
 GEKOKUJO_JAP: "Age of Gekokujo"
 GEKOKUJO_DESC: "The Ouchi left Kyoto in 1518, and in the time that had passed the political situation of Japan had changed drastically, and this would become even more apparent in the years immediately following their depature. Under the inspired leadership of Tsunehisa Amago, the Amago had risen from a minor Kokujin to controlling a significant fiefdom in Chugoku, the Aki families had revolted, and the Uragami threw off the yoke of the Akamatsu in Bizen. The Miyoshi had established their headquarters in Izumi, while Sukemasa Azai and Nobuhide Oda would do so at Odani and Nagoya respectively, all three asserting de-facto independence. Meanwhile, Ujitsuna Hojo stood poised to expand deeper into Kanto and further erode the old order."
 HANAGURA_JAP: "The Imagawa Civil War"
 HANAGURA_DESC: "Ujichika Imagawa was a brilliant administrator and general, but made a number of questionable decisions. Amongst them was building Nagoya Castle while having only a tenuous grip on Owari - a castle that would become the Oda's main base - and sending all his spare sons off to be monks. When his successor, Ujiteru, died unexpectedly, the Imagawa fell into a civil war. Meanwhile, Harumoto Hosokawa, Sadayori Rokkaku, Takakage Asakura and Tamekage Nagao all prepared to campaign against the Ikko Ikki, and the aging Tsunehisa Amago crushed his youngest son's revolt and moved to exploit the recent death of his rival in Yamaguchi."
 KAWAGOE_JAP: "The Siege of Kawagoe Castle"
 KAWAGOE_DESC: "In the east: the Hojo clan under its greenhorn Daimyo, Ujiyasu, would cement its dominant position in Kanto by crushing the Uesugi-Ashikaga army at the walls of Kawagoe Castle in a daring night raid, the young Nobuharu Takeda was blunted in his push into Shinano, while the war between Tanemune Date and his son, Harumune, would enter its final stages. In the west: the Shimazu branches had been reunified under a single head, while the Amago dealt a stultifying defeat to the Ouchi, the fallout of which the Mori used to expand their powerbase. In Kansai, Nagayoshi Miyoshi and Dosan Saito had overthrown their lords."
 ALLIANCE_BM_JAP: "The Triple Alliance"
 ALLIANCE_BM_DESC: "The brainchild of Sessai Taigen, Yoshimoto Imagawa's second-in-command, the Triple Alliance between the Imagawa, Hojo and Takeda was a political masterstroke that would allow the Imagawa to begin their march to Kyoto in full. While the Hojo squared off against the remaining clans of Kanto, Shingen Takeda would come to blows with Kagetora Nagao in Shinano. Additionally, after revolting and killing his weak lord to preserve the Ouchi, Harukata Sue would come to a standoff with a defiant Motonari Mori in Aki, while Takanobu Ryuzoji had overthrown the Shoni in Hizen and taken revenge for the murder of his father."
 COALITION_JAP: "Tenka Fubu"
 COALITION_DESC: "Nobunaga Oda's miraculous victory at Okehazama had irrevocably shaken the integrity of the Imagawa. His conquest of Mino cemented his position as a regional power. His occupation of the capital and installation of Yoshiaki Ashikaga put him forth as a possible national hegemon. Yoshiaki, however, refused to play the puppet, and orchestrated a coalition against his benefactor. Despite that, two other powers still stood a chance at pushing their way into the Kinai. Shingen Takeda, having conquered Shinano and Kozuke, broke his alliance with the Imagawa to partition their realm with Ieyasu Tokugawa, only to have Ujiyasu Hojo attack him in turn. Motonari Mori destroyed the Ouchi and crushed the Amago after Itsukushima, but his expansion into Kyushu was blocked by Sorin Otomo, the sickly yet clever lord of Bungo and brother of Yoshinaga Ouchi. And while on the verge of success, one of Sorin's schemes would see Ouchi and Amago partisans wrack the Mori domain."
 HONNOJI_JAP: "The Incident at Honnoji"
 HONNOJI_DESC: "In the years following his arrival in the capital, after many brutal and difficult campaigns, Nobunaga Oda either defeated or brought all opposition to his push for unification to the brink of destruction. When he arrived in Honnoji on June 20th, his rule looked to be an inevitability. On June 21st that had changed; murdered by Mitsuhide Akechi, Nobunaga's other generals quickly found themselves in a precarious position and rushed back to challenge the usurper. Other regional clans that had given up hope suddenly regained it; the Warring States were far from over."
 SEKIGAHARA_JAP: "The Sekigahara Campaign"
 SEKIGAHARA_DESC: "Hideyoshi Hashiba had emerged as the winner in the aftermath of Nobunaga's murder, slaying Mitsuhide Akechi and defeating the Oda loyalists under Katsuie Shibata a year later. Striking up alliances with former enemies and going on campaigns of subjugation, he took the name Toyotomi and finally unified Japan by crushing the Hojo at Odawara in 1590. But the untimely death of the peasant-turned-regent left a child on his throne. While the Council he had set up was able to maintain order for a while, the death of Toshiie Maeda gave Ieyasu Tokugawa the opportunity to sieze the nation. The remaining Toyotomi Loyalists rallied around Mitsunari Ishida, the Otomo in the west and Uesugi in the east rising up to divide the Tokugawa and let Mitsunari seize the capital."
 ROYALE_JAP: "Battle Royale"
 ROYALE_DESC: "Play as any of the notable clans of the Sengoku Jidai in this fictional scenario."
 cadastral_desc: "A unique characteristic of sengoku daimyo administration was regular surveys not just of newly conquered territory or the daimyo's own lands, but of all his territory, regardless of ownership. These surveys were valuable not just because they ensured the daimyo would receive accurate tax payments but also because they could potentially reduce disputes among his vassals and peasants."

 kokudaka_system_i: "Kokudaka System"
 rangaku_i: "Rangaku"
 desc_feudalism_i: "With the gradual decline of power in the Imperial Household, the Regents appointed by it gradually came to assume more of it. In turn, the warriors who backed up the Regent's authority and would eventually usurp it became the real power in Japan. Thus began the rise of feudalism in Japan."
 desc_higashiyama_culture_i: "Higashiyama Culture emerged in the aftermath of the Onin War and emphasized simplicity and the values of the Zen school of Buddhism - perhaps as a reaction to the increasingly complex political climate. This artistic period would also see many architectural innovations and the rise of tea ceremony."
 desc_militarized_aristocracy_i: "With the breakdown of what little authority Kyoto was still able to exercise over the Shugo, the provincial lords either accumulated more power or lost it to their own vassals. As conflict became the norm, violent struggles and merit on the battlefield determined the success of a clan."
 desc_western_trade_i: "The advent of the Portuguese in Japan changed the country forever; the introduction of firearms and Christianity were its largest impacts, but for the time, food, fashion, language, architecture and every field of knoweldge became impacted by the arrival of the west, and clans often fought for the ability to host a carrack."
 desc_gunsmithing_i: "While Europeans frequently brought large amount of firearms to Japan, figuring out how to reproduce the weapons was one of the first tasks the Japanese set about after their first encounter with the west. Not a decade passed by before firearms had been proliferated across Kyushu, and manufactories had been set up in Kansai."
 desc_momoyama_culture_i: "As Japan began to be reunified and grew increasingly familiar with the west, culture continued to change and be refined. Major Castle-Towns became increasingly cosmopolitan, tea ceremony became even more formalized, new forms of poetry were explored, and western fashions and foods became popular. All the while, new styles of governance and warfare were explored."
 desc_kokudaka_system_i: "The Kokudaka system was a radical shift in terms of administration; granting land in terms of its rice output rather than physical size. This allowed for the most important land to be assigned to the most trustworthy, and for a more accurate assessment of the worth of said land."
 desc_rangaku_i: "While western knowledge was constantly disseminated into Japan via the efforts of missionaries, eventually a school of thought emerged that actively attempted to understand and adopt what western technolgy was permitted after Japan entered isolation."
