 centralized_retainers_branches:0 "Centralize the Retainers and Branches"
 centralized_retainers_branches_desc:0 "The biggest contribution to the decline of our clan was the lack of a defined line of succession compounded with the branches being or relatively equal power.

 shinano_coalitions:0 "Coalitions of Shinano"
 shinano_coalitions_desc:0 "Shinano has rarely been unified in anything more than in name - and while all the clans of it and our neighbors dream of bringing the province to heel, the clans of Shinano are at least wise enough to always band together under strong leadership in the face of a greater threat. A wise Daimyo can coopt such into their clan structure."
