 rangaku_i: "Rangaku"
 desc_feudalism_i: "With the gradual decline of power in the Imperial Household, the Regents appointed by it gradually came to assume more of it. In turn, the warriors who backed up the Regent's authority and would eventually usurp it became the real power in Japan. Thus began the rise of feudalism in Japan."
 desc_higashiyama_culture_i: "Higashiyama Culture emerged in the aftermath of the Onin War and emphasized simplicity and the values of the Zen school of Buddhism - perhaps as a reaction to the increasingly complex political climate. This artistic period would also see many architectural innovations and the rise of tea ceremony."
 desc_militarized_aristocracy_i: "With the breakdown of what little authority Kyoto was still able to exercise over the Shugo, the provincial lords either accumulated more power or lost it to their own vassals. As conflict became the norm, violent struggles and merit on the battlefield determined the success of a clan."
 desc_western_trade_i: "The advent of the Portuguese in Japan changed the country forever; the introduction of firearms and Christianity were its largest impacts, but for the time, food, fashion, language, architecture and every field of knoweldge became impacted by the arrival of the west, and clans often fought for the ability to host a carrack."
 desc_gunsmithing_i: "While Europeans frequently brought large amount of firearms to Japan, figuring out how to reproduce the weapons was one of the first tasks the Japanese set about after their first encounter with the west. Not a decade passed by before firearms had been proliferated across Kyushu, and manufactories had been set up in Kansai."
 desc_momoyama_culture_i: "As Japan began to be reunified and grew increasingly familiar with the west, culture continued to change and be refined. Major Castle-Towns became increasingly cosmopolitan, tea ceremony became even more formalized, new forms of poetry were explored, and western fashions and foods became popular. All the while, new styles of governance and warfare were explored."
 desc_kokudaka_system_i: "The Kokudaka system was a radical shift in terms of administration; granting land in terms of its rice output rather than physical size. This allowed for the most important land to be assigned to the most trustworthy, and for a more accurate assessment of the worth of said land."
 desc_rangaku_i: "While western knowledge was constantly disseminated into Japan via the efforts of missionaries, eventually a school of thought emerged that actively attempted to understand and adopt what western technolgy was permitted after Japan entered isolation."
