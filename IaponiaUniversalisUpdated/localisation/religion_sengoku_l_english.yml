Founded by Ignatius Loyla only a few decades before the offical start of the Counter-Reformatio, and then made famous by St. Francis Xavier, the first missionary to Japan, they embodied both the moral strigency and intellectualism of the Counter-Reformation."
 franciscan_school_desc: "The Spanish-sponsored Franciscans were the group to follow the Jesuits, arriving in Japan after nearly a century of a rival monopoly. Rejecting both the extravagance of the Jesuits and the theological accomodation they showed in China, they focused more on monasticism and their clerical vows of poverty, in addition to advocating for closer ties with Spain."

 #TODO: fix these below
 ryukyu_faith.1.t: "Harmonization of Kamuism"
 ryukyu_faith.1.d: "Our efforts to integrate our Ainu subjects have now finally started to pay off. Our pagan subjects have begun to accept the ideals of Confucianism and our local officials have also integrated elements of the local religion and culture in our wider Confucian corpus of ideals. As local bureaucrats enter our administration the pagan customs have to some extent began to filter upwards. Even among prominent officials in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] a small altar can sometimes be found to a TODO!Bear? Crab??? Owl?????.\nPaganism has become one of the many religions of our Confucian [Root.GovernmentName]."
 ryukyu_faith.1.a: "'Submit the people of virtue, assimilate the people with enlightenment.'"
 ryukyu_faith.2.t: "Harmonization of Christianity"
 ryukyu_faith.2.d: "Over time our Christian subjects have grown accustomed to our ways and taken to our rites and our superior administrative ideals. Where there was once distrust in the classics and our system for education and governance there is now widespread understanding. In turn our Christian subjects have been taken in and made part of our [Root.GovernmentName], and some of their customs have now become ours. In [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] even some of the best educated Confucian scholars can be seen partaking in Christian customs and visiting Christian churches."
 ryukyu_faith.2.a: "'Submit the people of virtue, assimilate the people with enlightenment.'"
 ryukyu_faith.7.t: "Harmonization of the Japanese Faiths"
 ryukyu_faith.7.d: "The Japanese have over time come to incorporate both the traditions of Confucius and Buddha into their own old Shinto faith, taking what they feel was the truest and best serving parts of the foreign teachings and making it their own. In many ways this has in turn made their religion easier to incorporate and harmonize with the ideology of [Root.GetName]. As time goes by the Shinto identity becomes less and less of an issue and Shinto followers can be found high and low in [Root.GetAdjective] society, forming a new group within our complex government apparatus that an outsider would have a very hard time distinguishing from our own."
 ryukyu_faith.7.a: "'Submit the people of virtue, assimilate the people with enlightenment.'"

 ryukyu_faith.11.t: "Concept of Shangdi"
 ryukyu_faith.11.d: "The followers of the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faith have increasingly come to integrate Confucian concepts and our rites in their daily life. A recent trend is to identify the concept of Shangdi with their own supreme deities. This interpretation is somewhat unorthodox to the scholar experts of our [Root.GovernmentName], but it has allowed the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faithful to integrate a number of Confucian concepts, rites, constants and classical teaching in their theology.\nThere is some debate in the palace halls of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] if this is the right and proper way on the path for the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] adherents to elevate themselves from barbarians to Hua."
 ryukyu_faith.11.a: "We must teach them the proper ways!"
 ryukyu_faith.11.b: "Let us accommodate this abstraction."
 ryukyu_faith.12.t: "Translations of the Classics"
 ryukyu_faith.12.d:1 "Believers of the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faith are a people with strong traditions and rites and their adherence to the archaic language of their own teachings is holding them back from progressing towards civilization. If they are to ever elevate themselves from the Barbarian Yi of this world we must perhaps ensure that the classics and the proper rites are available for them to digest in their own language.\nThere are some scholars that have already begun to create such works. Should we encourage them to continue synthesizing their old religious concepts with the sublime principles of Confucius?"
 ryukyu_faith.12.a: "Let them create their own version of proper form."
 ryukyu_faith.12.b: "This would be a travesty on our ideology!"
 ryukyu_faith.13.t: "Faith of [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName]"
 ryukyu_faith.13.d: "Our trusted minister and confidant, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] has worked closely with our [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] community in order to help them elevate their barbarian culture. Surprised at [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] findings, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has started to adopt many [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] concepts after studying their science and literature intensely. Many worry that [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has gotten too taken in by [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] ways. Some even claim that our [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetTitle] has secretly converted, shaming [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] ancestors and the [Root.GovernmentName] alike."

 ryukyu_faith.13.b: "We have much to learn from the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] people."
 ryukyu_faith.14.t: "Rights and Rite"
 ryukyu_faith.14.d:1 "While they are part of our [Root.GovernmentName] some [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] traditions can be very hard to stomach. A civilized people is supposed to abide by what is right and logical according the Confucian teachings, but these men and women have many customs in direct contradiction of such rules. Our officials in [harmonization_province.GetName] have been struggling with the locals who insist on their barbarous ways."
 ryukyu_faith.14.a: "Barbarians!"
 ryukyu_faith.14.b: "Such minor things do not concern us."
 ryukyu_faith.15.t: "Empowering the Office of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 ryukyu_faith.15.d: "While the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] are barbarians, they have some customs and rites that we might make use of. As their traditions and ceremonies regarding rulership already contains a concept of a high worldly power such as our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] this is something we could make good use of. Local officials in [harmonization_province.GetName] have already been doing so but it has been suggested that we make use of [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] ceremonies even at higher levels. Others argue that we would be shaming our ancestors and turning our back on what is proper if we allowed these traditions to contaminate ours."
 ryukyu_faith.15.a: "I like the sound of this..."
 ryukyu_faith.15.b: "It is the shameful officials we need to deal with!"
 ryukyu_faith.16.t: "Bringing Civilization to the Barbarians"
 ryukyu_faith.16.d:2 "Over time the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] people have come to take to many of our customs. When our [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetTitle] [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetName] visited the area of [harmonization_province.GetName], [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetSheHe] found that they are still far from civilized, however. When a local influential landholder, Lord [Root.local_influential_person.GetName], invited [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetHerHim] to participate in a naming ceremony for his son in which he named the boy after himself, that was the final straw.\n\n[Root.Dip_Advisor.GetName] returned from the area with a very low opinion of the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] people and of their prospects to ever count themselves among the civilized people of the world."
 ryukyu_faith.16.a: "We will leave them to their own devices then."
 ryukyu_faith.16.b: "Let us send our best and brightest to civilize them."
 ryukyu_faith.17.t: "[harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] Civilization"
 ryukyu_faith.17.d:2 "Some barbarians are more susceptible to reason and intellect than others. The [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] people of [harmonization_province.GetName] have already taken to many of our traditions, from the more important to even minor things. Visiting foreigners have a hard time telling the region apart from [Root.GetName] proper as apart from some minor eccentricities the [Root.Capital.Culture.GetName] language, names and customs seem as [Root.GetAdjective] as any part of the [Root.GetName] [Root.GovernmentName]."
